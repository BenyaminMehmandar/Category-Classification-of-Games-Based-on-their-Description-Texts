This repository showcases my endeavor to advance natural language processing capabilities for the Persian language. This project is dedicated to designing an NLP model that effectively categorizes game description texts into 10 distinct categories. By harnessing the power of BERT models and tailored techniques, I've meticulously crafted an architecture that demonstrates exceptional performance. Through rigorous experimentation and fine-tuning, the trained model achieved a remarkable 76% balanced accuracy on previously unseen data.
